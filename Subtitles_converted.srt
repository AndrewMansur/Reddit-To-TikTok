0,00,00 --> 0,00,04
So, here comes the mandatory "I didn't fuck up today" part

3
0,00,04 --> 0,00,21
This has been an ongoing thing for the past year or so.

&#x200B;

A bit less than a year ago me and a female friend of mine got together and hung out by ourselves a few times (separate from our fiend group)

4
0,00,21 --> 0,00,32
This led to her confessing her feelings for me, but that she would be happy with any type of relationship between us that's more than just friends

5
0,00,32 --> 0,00,46
And due to me not being romantically attracted to her, we settled on a "fuckbuddy" relationship.

This went on for about a month or two, when all of a sudden, she had something to say to me

6
0,00,46 --> 0,00,59
Another friend we share had talked to her about having a crush on me, and she felt the need to tell me as were more than just friends at the time

7
0,00,59 --> 0,01,08
She also made it very clear that because we weren't in a real relationship I could pursue this other girl if I wanted to

8
0,01,08 --> 0,01,21
Which is what I did.

After a week of time to think, I told her about my desicion, which obviously made her sad, and this is just the start of the fuck-up

9
0,01,21 --> 0,01,34
Because we were both friends with the other girl, and because she had offered to do it, I actually asked this girl to help me get together with the other girl

10
0,01,34 --> 0,01,54
I completely failed to think about her feelings and how this would affect her, and how she had genuinely told me how she had romantic feelings for me.

Long story short, it didn't work out between me and the other girl, who found another guy, and I was all alone again

11
0,01,54 --> 0,02,00
Me and the first girls friendship was ruined, and we felt alot like strangers

12
0,02,00 --> 0,02,04
But then some months passed, and as they say: time heals

13
0,02,04 --> 0,02,13
We were friends again, and after a while, we were alone, just the two of us for the first time in months

14
0,02,13 --> 0,02,23
I still felt guilty about the whole situation and didn't want to make a move, but she did and we became something like fuckbuddies again

15
0,02,23 --> 0,02,39
She claimed that, because she didn't really care about me anymore, she didn't mind what happened that summer.

Mind you, our little relationship was completely secret from everyone at this time, but as school started again, people started to notice

16
0,02,39 --> 0,02,50
It went far enough to where our friends straight up confronted us about us, and made us "confess" what was going on (although that's a different story)

17
0,02,50 --> 0,02,59
Now the cat was out of the bag, and after a few weeks, me and her decided to actually become boyfriend and girlfriend

18
0,02,59 --> 0,03,14
I had realised thoughout this journey what truly matters in a partner, and I saw everything I ever could want in this girl.

We've now been together for 4-5 months, and my past mistakes are constantly affecting us

19
0,03,14 --> 0,03,27
Not too long ago she explained how because she now cares about me alot, and has extreme feelings for me, these past events are no longer as insignificant as they were months ago

20
0,03,27 --> 0,03,37
What I did back then changed her and her self esteem a lot, and she will probably never be able to let it go completely

21
0,03,37 --> 0,03,48
It has gone so far as to her telling me that she is worried about our relationship, and she is unsure if we will even work out

22
0,03,48 --> 0,03,51
And I have noone but myself to blame

23
0,03,51 --> 0,04,06
I am really bad at considering how other people feel, and I can't even begin to fathom how she must've felt when I left her for someone else, and even wanted her help in doing it

24
0,04,06 --> 0,04,09
I just keep fucking up over and over again

25
0,04,09 --> 0,04,22
For example; me and my friends were going to hang out with some other people yesterday, and we were all supposed to come, but my girlfriend didn't feel like doing it

26
0,04,22 --> 0,04,36
Instead of considering her feelins and supporting her, I kept egging her to go because I selfishly wanted her company.

Today, I sent her a goodmorning text, as I always do, and she just blocked me

27
0,04,36 --> 0,04,37


It's truly maddening

28
0,04,37 --> 0,04,40
I am extremely worried about our relationship

29
0,04,40 --> 0,04,42
I am just madly in love

30
0,04,42 --> 0,04,45
I would do anything for this girl

31
0,04,45 --> 0,04,49
But I feel like thread that's slowly being torn apart

32
0,04,49 --> 0,04,51
I would kill for her

33
0,04,51 --> 0,04,54
But I don't think this will last

34
0,04,54 --> 0,05,10
I really just want it all to end.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I left my "fuckbuddy" for someone else \~8 months ago, and that "fuckbuddy" is now the love of my life, who might leave me due to what I did.
