2
0,00,00 --> 0,00,02
I stole an air purifier from Walmart

3
0,00,02 --> 0,00,06
Even the small ones for a bedroom are really expensive

4
0,00,06 --> 0,00,11
My dog was born with heart problems and he just turned 9

5
0,00,11 --> 0,00,19
He’s been on medicine for over almost 2 years now and they’ve upped his medicine twice in a year

6
0,00,19 --> 0,00,22
His cough recently has gotten really bad

7
0,00,22 --> 0,00,26
I have an appointment for the vet in like 2 weeks

8
0,00,26 --> 0,00,38
I looked up some ways to help his cough (besides all the medicine he’s already on) and to rid the lungs of fluid is to improve the over all air quality

9
0,00,38 --> 0,00,46
So I already have a small humidifier to help loosen the mucus but I needed an air purifier

10
0,00,46 --> 0,00,56
I just wanted a small one for my bedroom to see if it helps but the smallest one I could find at Wally World was like $70

11
0,00,56 --> 0,01,09
I’ve been feeling really guilty but his cough has just been getting worse and I can’t move up the appointment but I couldn’t afford the purifier and I’m really hoping it helps.
